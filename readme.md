# 📘 Java DSA Revision

This repository contains my personal collection of **Java-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice code. It's designed to help reinforce fundamental concepts, explore common problem patterns, and build a solid foundation for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is modular, organized by categories such as patterns, number operations, and classic problems.

```
├── Number Pattern/                # Programs that print number-based patterns
├── Star Pattern/                 # Classic star-based visual patterns
├── PairSum.java                  # Finds all pairs in an array that sum up to a target
├── SumOfEvenNumberTillN.java    # Sums all even numbers up to a given value N
├── fahrenheitToCelsius.java     # Converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius
├── findCharacterCase.java       # Identifies if a character is uppercase/lowercase/other
```

> ✅ This structure will **expand over time** with more problems and categories:
> - Arrays & Strings
> - Recursion & Backtracking
> - Sorting & Searching
> - Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
> - Trees & Graphs
> - Dynamic Programming
> - Bit Manipulation
> - and more...

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Strengthen core Java skills with hands-on examples
- ✅ Build confidence in solving common DSA problems
- ✅ Prepare for interviews & coding assessments
- ✅ Maintain a growing and well-structured DSA library

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of terminal or IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ)

### Compile and Run

Use the terminal:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Or open the `.java` file in your IDE and run it directly.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (and Growing)

- ✅ Basic loops & conditionals
- ✅ Pattern printing (stars, numbers, etc.)
- ✅ Type conversion & user input
- ✅ Mathematical and logical operations
- 🔜 Arrays & Strings
- 🔜 Sorting & Searching
- 🔜 Recursion and Backtracking
- 🔜 Tree and Graph implementations

## 📌 Contribution & Expansion

This is a personal revision project, but contributions and feedback are always welcome. As the project evolves, I will be:

- Adding more DSA categories
- Refactoring common utilities (e.g., Input handlers)
- Optimizing code for performance & readability
